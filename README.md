## Hi there, Saajan here! 👋

I am a college sophomore driven by curiosity and a willingness to learn by doing. I take calculated risks to explore new ideas, quickly prototype solutions, and iterate until something useful emerges. I'm passionate about building practical software — from web apps to machine learning models — that can make an impact. Open to collaboration, internships, and projects that push my limits and help me grow as an engineer.
